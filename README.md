AWS Real-Time Threat Detection and Prevention 🚀
This project focuses on implementing a comprehensive real-time threat monitoring and detection system using AWS services. It ensures enhanced security for organizational infrastructures by identifying and remediating potential security threats.
Features 🌟

• **Threat Detection:** Leverages AWS GuardDuty to detect malicious behavior using AWS CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS Logs.
• **Real-Time Alerts:** Automatically generates findings for unexpected and potentially harmful activities in your AWS environment.
• **Automated Remediation:** Uses AWS CloudWatch Events and Lambda functions to respond to threats in real-time.
• **Scalable Solution:** Designed to handle dynamic cloud environments with minimal manual intervention.

Workflow 🔄

1. **Threat Detection:** AWS GuardDuty monitors the environment for suspicious activity.
2. **Finding Generation:** GuardDuty generates findings upon detecting malicious behavior.
3. **Event Capture:** AWS CloudWatch captures events based on GuardDuty findings.
4. **Automated Remediation:** Lambda functions execute predefined actions to mitigate threats.

AWS Services Used ☁️

1. **AWS GuardDuty:** Managed threat detection service.
2. **AWS CloudWatch Events:** Event-driven orchestration.
3. **AWS Lambda:** Serverless function execution for automated responses.
4. **AWS CloudTrail:** Logs API activity and resources access.
5. **Amazon VPC Flow Logs:** Captures network flow data for analysis.
6. **DNS Logs:** Monitors DNS queries for suspicious patterns.
